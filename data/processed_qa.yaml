  Context:
  - 'In March 1983, Earth was subjected to cosmic rays that gave  superpowers, resulting
    in a rise of supervillains known as Miscreants. With no one able to stop the Miscreants,
    normal people are usually left living in fear of being attacked by them. After
    a Miscreant kills her geneticist parents on their way home from work, Emily Stanton
    becomes determined to find a way to stop Miscreants.


    By 1985, Emily has sacrificed much of her social life in favor of researching
    possible methods of fighting back against Miscreants. While this results in her
    being bullied, Lydia Berman stands up for her and becomes her best and only friend.
    Lydia supports Emily''s dream of giving  to normal people, though she tries to
    make sure that Emily does not overwork herself. When Lydia convinces Emily to
    take a half-hour nap from studying in 1993, she accidentally causes Emily to oversleep
    and wake up late for an AP exam, straining their relationship and causing them
    to drift apart.


    In 2024, Emily and Lydia have gone their separate ways, with Emily becoming a
    successful scientist and researcher for her own company and Lydia becoming a longshoreman.
    Lydia tries to reconnect with Emily when their high school reunion comes around
    and invites her to come. When she fails to show up on the night of the reunion,
    Lydia concludes that Emily is still uncomfortable attending parties by herself
    and goes to pick her up. Emily tells her that while she would have liked to go
    to the reunion, she had forgotten when the reunion was and had a project she had
    to work on that night, which Emily wants to show to Lydia. Unfortunately, Lydia
    accidentally injects herself with a serum Emily had been working on.


    Having been injected with the serum, Lydia learns from Emily that the serum was
    designed to give a normal person superhuman strength and that she would have to
    undergo special training and treatment so the serum does not kill her. Emily also
    joins Lydia in the treatment, although a less painful one since Emily took the
    serum in a pill form to take the other superpower concocted, invisibility. During
    the thirty-three day treatment and training, Lydia and Emily grow closer. Lydia
    discovers that in the years since their high school graduation, Emily had a daughter,
    Tracy, with one of the researchers, who could not handle the responsibility and
    left them.


    Once they finish their training and treatment, Emily and Lydia foil a liquor store
    robbery run by a Miscreant with crab arms known as the Crab, who falls in love
    with an equally smitten Lydia, much to Emily''s concern. Emily and Lydia, known
    as the superhero team Thunder Force, are praised for their heroics. This brings
    Thunder Force to the attention of mayoral candidate William "The King" Stevens,
    whose campaign is built on the idea that only he can end the Miscreants'' crimes.


    With the help of Laser, a Miscreant who can generate and control whip-like energy
    beams, the King tries to get Thunder Force to work for him, leaving Chicago at
    the mercy of the Miscreants unless he wins the mayoral election. Thunder Force
    continues to fight crime with their superpowers and support the rival mayoral
    candidate, thereby causing the King to lose the election. The King then sends
    Laser to attack Thunder Force when they''re at a diner. When she tries to get
    away, Lydia throws a bus at her despite Emily''s protests. Though nobody was hurt,
    Emily decides that Lydia''s impulsiveness is more problematic than beneficial,
    once again straining their friendship.


    In an effort to make amends, Lydia goes on a date with the Crab to get some useful
    information. Along with how the Crab is a misunderstood person who had to turn
    to a life of crime, Lydia learns that the King is planning on blowing up everyone
    who did not vote for him in the election, along with the new mayor, at a party
    he''s hosting under the guise of a celebration of the new mayor. She tells Emily
    of what she learned and makes amends with her.


    After fighting off Laser one last time, Thunder Force go to stop the King from
    bombing the building. When they manage to find the bomb, the King decides to fight
    Thunder Force himself, revealing himself to be a Miscreant with superhuman strength,
    though significantly stronger than Lydia. Before the King can kill Lydia, the
    Crab double crosses the King and gets his claws broken off. Tracy also joins the
    fight, having injected herself with her mother''s serum, giving her the ability
    to run at superhuman speed. Though they manage to take the King down, Thunder
    Force realizes that the bomb will go off before they can disarm it.


    With no guarantee that the bomb would be stable enough to not go off while Tracy
    carries the bomb to somewhere safe, Lydia decides to sacrifice herself, knowing
    that she can at least reduce the impact of the explosion. She jumps out of the
    building with the bomb and dives into the Chicago River, seemingly dying in the
    explosion. However, the  manage to find her body and  her. Thunder Force, now
    with a stronger friendship between Emily and Lydia, are offered by the mayor the
    assistance of the city''s resources, which they accept.'

    fled to a  space colony. A young astronaut named Blake from the Kepler colony
    returns to Earth with fellow astronauts Tucker and Holden. Their mission is to
    test whether Earth is suitable for human habitation and reproduction. Kepler-209
    residents have modern technology and space travel but they have become infertile
    from heavy radiation there. This is the second attempt to return to Earth.


    The space capsule lands roughly on a tidal flat near the Henderson Hub, a weather
    beacon that broadcasts telemetry data back to Kepler-209. Holden is killed, while

    that he has been locked away because he sided with the Muds, believing that Kepler
    residents should never return to Earth. Gibson introduces Blake to his adoptive
    son and his partner - she claims that he saved her and her son from certain death.
    After a brief reunion, Blake discovers the girls are being held captive for Gibson''s
    future breeding plans. She sides with the Muds, attacks the guards, and releases
    the girls and their families.


    After freeing the Muds, she goes to free her father. She notices Gibson moving
    toward the Henderson Hub. Blake comes to know that Gibson''s adoptive son Neil
    is actually her half-brother (after her father impregnated Neil’s mother). Blake’s
    fertility info is then attempted to be communicated by Gibson from the biometer
    which proves fertility of Keplers. She tries to stop news from Earth being broadcast
    back to Kepler-209, but Gibson sends the data. Blake strangles and drowns Gibson,
    almost drowning herself, but Maila''s mother rescues her and revives her. Blake
    and her father rejoin the Muds and Neil and they set out in a tugboat. A closing
    scene shows the Mud children hidden from the prior Kepler raiders fearfully watching
    an approach of figures through the fog, which turn out to be their kidnapped parents
    returning safely home.'
  - 'In 2063, astrophysicists on a climate-change-ravaged Earth find a habitable planet.
    A scouting mission is sent, although the roughly 86-year flight means that the
    grandchildren of the launch crew astronauts will be the ones who reach the planet.
    To help the launch crew cope with the knowledge that their remaining lives will
    be spent mostly in flight, the original 30 are bred through  and kept in isolation
    from the rest of the world. To extend their time in flight, they are launched
    on the  spaceship as pre-teens, with a single adult, senior program commander
    Richard, to guide them through the early part of the journey. The plan is for
    IVF to be performed when the crew turns 24, to be repeated on those offspring
    when they turn 24.


    During the tenth year of the flight, Christopher and Zac discover  the grown teenagers
    are being given a chemical in their food to suppress sex drive and pleasure response,
    keeping them docile and manageable. The pair stops taking the chemical, and their
    surging hormones drive them to become competitive, careless, and anxious to engage
    in sexual relations, particularly with crew mate Sela who has trained as chief
    medical officer.


    During a repair effort outside the  to address a failed Earth communication system,
    chief officer Richard is killed and a fire damages more ship systems. Christopher
    is voted the new chief officer, which upsets Zac, who then tells the others to
    stop ingesting the chemical. The mission descends into madness as many of the
    young men and women revert to their most primal state.


    Zac tells the others an alien killed Richard, and he will protect them, letting
    them eat all the (closely conserved) food they want. He convinces all but five
    to follow him rather than Christopher. Christopher and Sela, who have become a
    couple, find and repair a video disk that reveals Zac killed Richard and precipitated
    the further systems damage by turning on the electricity to the communications
    array while Richard was working on it. They show the others, but Zac convinces
    many that an alien is inhabiting one of them, and his followers murder anyone
    Zac targets.


    Christopher inadvertently leads Zac to a weapons cache for their grandchildren
    to use on the planet. Christopher, Sela, and Phoebe are the only holdouts. Phoebe
    is killed as the pack searches for Christopher and Sela. The pair tricks Zac into
    being ejected into space, and peace returns to . Sela is voted chief officer.
    The crew permanently forgoes the suppression chemical and learn to manage their
    emotions. They fall in love and have children naturally rather than via the planned
    IVF.


    Decades later,  and its multi-generational crew arrive at the planet, which appears
    from orbit to be as earth-like as hoped.'
  - 'The short film opens up with an unnamed astronaut planting a garden in his spaceship
    but doesn''t realize that a meteor is on its way to crashing into the spaceship.
    As a result, his spaceship is destroyed, and he is left alone on a small deserted
    planet. He later removes plants from his garden and plants them on the planet,
    but in a matter of hours, the plants wither without air or water. He later witnesses  crash
    into the planet, which makes him believe there was someone on the ship. His plants
    suddenly regrow and create a tree, and notices a pinkish female alien with  hair
    making the tree grow. They later develop a relationship based on love at first
    sight, and the alien later removes plants from the spaceship to plant them into
    the planet, essentially making it a larger garden. The astronaut later decides
    to remove his helmet, but nearly dies from asphyxia. The alien decides to give
    him some of her air to make him breathe.


    Some months later, the astronaut spends his time with her, and taught her a few
    things like eating mangos. As the years go by, the couple develops their relationship
    and is seen having two daughters who have their own treats from their parents,
    an older girl with her mother''s hair but closely realistic to her father''s and
    a young girl with her father''s hair but closely to her mother''s ribbon hair.
    The alien later is seen as weak, to the point where she can no longer eat and/or
    walk. As a result, the planet withers and she dies into an aurora, which causes
    the astronaut to nearly die from asphyxia again til he nearly lives when he wakes
    up to his daughters, who are giving him air so that he can breathe again and make
    the planet regrows in an instant, revealing they have their mother''s powers in
    them.


    During the post-credits scenes, as he''s sleeping with his daughters and a pet
    alien dog, the astronaut witnesses another spaceship crash into the planet. Curious
    though, he and his daughters go to check out only to discover something that made
    him blush.'
  - 'In the year 2031, humanity establishes its first  on Mars. By 2042, "the Alliance"
    world government has been formed and quantum propulsion technology allows humanity
    to travel beyond the solar system. The Mars colony fails in 2281 and the Alliance
    controls three colonies: Earth, Zafdie, and Ellora. In 2519, Zafdie attempts to
    secede from the Alliance. During the ensuing war,  James Ford drops a quantum
    bomb ("Q-bomb") on the rebel colony, killing 70 million people. Ford is subsequently
    dishonorably discharged from the Alliance military and gains the sobriquet of
    "the Blood General." His wife, Doctor Lea Goss, leaves him.


    In 2524, miners of the Vander Mining Corp stationed on planet 4217LYA (Heracles
    System) encounter unseen aliens and Captain Juda Sayle reports an "" to Alliance
    Command. On Earth, General Eron Ryle is notified of the incident and orders that
    Goss and Ford be brought to him.


    At a local bar, Dash meets with Ford to discuss a potential job. A fight between
    them and civilians is interrupted by Commander Marcus Bleck, who passes on Ryle''s
    request for Ford''s counsel. Ford refuses but subsequently agrees upon the promise
    of him being reinstated and his military pension restored. At McMillian Airfield
    military base, Ford and Dash meet with Goss and Ryle for a situation briefing.
    Survivors of the FC incident are brought to the base for quarantine and questioning
    but quickly turn hostile and begin killing base personnel. The survivors appear
    to be infected, do not respond to attempts at communication, appear unfamiliar
    with human technology (though they quickly learn how to operate ), and "infect"
    several base personnel, who then themselves turn hostile. The infected humans
    attempt to board a transport ship but are stopped and eliminated by Ryle, Ford,
    Dash, and several other soldiers.


    While the Alliance Senate debates, Ryle authorizes Operation Comic Sin – with
    a strike team consisting of himself, Ford, Dash, Goss, Bleck,  Braxton (Ryle''s
    nephew), and technician Corporal Ardene (who is qualified to operate and arm a
    Q-bomb) – to launch a retaliatory and decisive counterstrike against the aliens.
    Ardene reports that a tachyon pulse was released by one of the infected miners
    during the base attack, which will allow the aliens to know Earth''s location
    in six or seven hours. The team is outfitted with small arms,  designed for combat
    and space environments, and a Q-bomb. The team plans to travel to the Ellora colony
    via , where Alliance forces have shot down an alien ship. The team intends to
    recover the downed ship and analyze the cosmic radiation to locate the alien''s
    home plant, then destroy it with the Q-bomb.


    The team arrives at incorrect coordinates in orbit of planet Ellora, in the middle
    of a battle between Alliance and alien spacefleets, and is forced to conduct an  through
    the space debris. Ryle, Goss, Ford, and Dash go missing during the drop, and the
    remainder of the team comes under enemy fire almost immediately after landing,
    with Bleck being critically wounded. Elloran survivors rescue the team and, after
    verifying the team is free of alien infection (infected persons cannot talk),
    the survivors reveal the aliens have invaded the planet and the area is swarming
    with alien troops and infected humans. The survivors offer to treat Bleck at their
    outpost''s medbay, and Ardene goes with them. Meanwhile, Braxton, accompanied
    by sniper Sol Cantos, proceeds to the downed alien ship. While analyzing the ship''s
    radiation, Braxton''s Icarus suit reports Ford as alive. He and Sol Cantos recover
    Ford, who experiences several visions of the aliens and Goss while , and the three
    reach the Alliance outpost. At the outpost, Ardene views video log recordings
    that reveal the aliens are a  that  by infecting victims, who then fall under
    the control of the hive mind.


    Braxton gives the coordinates of the alien''s home planet to Ardene, who reports
    the tachyon interference generated by the aliens means they cannot travel to the
    coordinates without first getting into orbit. Meanwhile, Ford consoles then  the
    mortally wounded Bleck. Dash is revealed to have survived and made his way to
    the outpost.


    Ardene discovers the aliens have built a stabilized quantum space gate near Ellora
    that will allow the alien armada, currently in the Sigea galaxy, to invade the
    Milky Way in force. The survivors plan to collapse the gateway with the Q-bomb
    by firing it via the outpost''s orbital cannon. While prepping the orbital cannon,
    Ardene receives a signal from Ryle, who has survived in orbit, albeit with his
    Icarus suit damaged and unfit for . He volunteers to position himself on the gateway
    and trigger his suit''s self-destruct to close the gate after the Q-bomb passes
    through.


    The aliens converge on the outpost and speak through an infected Goss, mocking
    Ford, preaching the superiority of "the Sigea", and offering the chance for humankind''s
    assimilation or death. After Dash replies with a simple "no," the Sigea begin
    their attack while Goss boards a Sigea ship. Ford latches onto the ship and later
    confronts the infected Goss as she prepares to cross via the completed space gate.
    With the orbital gun charged, Ardene loads the Q-bomb into a missile and fires
    it at the gate. Goss intercepts the Q-bomb missile in a , blows Ford into space,
    and crosses to join the assembled Sigea fleet.


    Ryle positions himself on the space gate and, unable to trigger his suit''s self-destruct,
    instead provides a target reference for the orbital gun. Ardene, with Braxton''s
    reluctant blessing, fires the gun on Ryle''s position, killing him and destroying
    the gate. The stasis field containing the Q-bomb missile fails and the bomb detonates
    on the other side of the collapsing gateway, the resulting black hole destroying
    the Sigea''s fleet and home star system. Braxton, stricken with grief over his
    uncle''s death, kills the Sigea''s field commander on Ellora.


    Back on Earth, seven days after first contact, Braxton, Ardene, Sol Cantos, Dash,
    and Ford morosely celebrate in a bar as the Alliance Senate proudly declares the
    remaining Sigea have unconditionally surrendered. Ford takes a , sadly reminisces
    about Goss, then abruptly leaves the bar.'

    Scorfano, a fellow sea monster child who lives alone in an abandoned tower on
    dry land. When Alberto encourages Luca to venture out of the ocean, he finds out
    that sea monsters turn into humans as long as they are dry. Luca begins sneaking
    out to meet Alberto and they become friends, wishing to own a Vespa and travel
    around the world.


    Upon discovering their son''s actions, Luca''s parents decide to send him to live
    in the  with his uncle Ugo. In retaliation, Luca runs away from home with Alberto
    to hide out in Portorosso. The boys run afoul of Ercole Visconti, the local bully
    and five-time champion of the Portorosso Cup, a triathlon of swimming, pasta-eating,
    and biking. When Ercole tries to soak Luca in a fountain, Giulia Marcovaldo, a
    young girl, stops him. In hopes of winning the money needed for a Vespa, the boys
    team up with Giulia for the triathlon.


    Giulia invites them to stay at her house and introduces her fisherman father,
    Massimo, who holds grudges towards sea monsters. Meanwhile, Luca''s parents infiltrate
    the town to find their son. Giulia and Luca bond over their love of learning,
    making Alberto jealous. When Luca shows interest in attending school, Alberto
    intentionally reveals his sea monster form to Giulia to prevent it. Unwilling

    flees as Ercole''s gang show up and try to hunt him. Heartbroken, Alberto trashes
    everything in his hiding place. Shortly after, Giulia finds out that Luca is a
    sea monster as well, and sends him away for his safety.


    Luca heads to Alberto''s hiding place in an effort to reconcile with him and learns

    They resume biking, with Ercole now trying to harpoon them for money, which is
    stopped by Giulia smashing her bike against his.

    Giulia. When Ercole and other townsfolk confront them, Massimo stands up for them
    and insists that they have won. A few of the townsfolk are revealed to be sea
    monsters as well and Luca is finally reunited with his family. The humans welcome
    the sea monsters, with the exception of Ercole, whose prejudice turns him into
    an outcast. His henchmen, who were fed up with his abuse, throw him into the fountain
    and abandon him.


    Luca and Alberto buy a Vespa, but Alberto sells it to get a train ticket for Luca,

  Answer_with_context: The 2021 film that features a time loop premise, where two

  Context:
  - A neurosurgeon who is stuck in a time loop tries to save his estranged wife from
    being killed by a mystery man.
  - 'Mark, a teenage boy, has been stuck in a time loop, repeating the same day over
    and over again. After many iterations of the loop, Mark has perfected several
    routines and is able to aid other people by anticipating their movements. Developing
    a crush on a girl he gives directions to, Mark goes to the community pool to meet
    her again, saving her from being knocked into the pool by a beach ball. However,
    his efforts to spend more time with her are constantly frustrated. One day, while
    Mark is waiting to save the girl from the beach ball, another girl, Margaret,
    unexpectedly intervenes. Mark tracks her down and discovers that she is also living
    in the same time loop.


    Mark and Margaret spend time together. Mark tells her about his desire to go to
    art school, and his father quitting his job to write a book on the ; she talks
    about her dream of working as a mission specialist for NASA, and how she has been
    looking for a missing dog. They become close. Mark brings up possible ways they
    could break the time loop, but Margaret is not interested in trying to escape
    it. Every evening she hurries off after receiving a text from a medical student
    named Jared, who Mark speculates must be her boyfriend.


    Mark and Margaret decide to look for moments of perfect beauty during the day;
    Mark conjectures that they might escape the time loop after finding all of them.
    To cheer Margaret up, Mark creates a mock-up of Tranquility Base in the school
    gym for her. Later, at his room, she sees a map he has created of the perfect
    moments. Mark leans in to kiss her, but she avoids the kiss, saying she does not
    want to be more than friends. The next day, when his dad comes to talk to him
    about his future, Mark calls him hypocritical for chasing his own dreams while
    thwarting Mark''s. After talking to his sister Emma, Mark learns their dad did
    not quit his job, but was fired and was too ashamed to reveal it.


    Mark suggests to Margaret that they might be able to break the loop if they go
    far away. They buy tickets to Tokyo, but Margaret leaves the plane before takeoff.
    When the plane crosses the International Date Line, Mark wakes up in his bedroom,
    realizing the plan did not work. He decides to focus on others in the next loop.
    He invites his father to tell him about the Civil War, and attends Emma''s soccer
    game, where she scores a goal that she did not score in the loops when he was
    not there. While attempting a skateboarding trick, Mark injures himself and is
    taken to the hospital. There, he sees Margaret visiting her mother, who is dying
    of cancer. Mark realizes that he is not the center of this story, but rather Margaret
    is.


    Margaret wakes up and manages to find the lost dog she has been searching for.
    She then has a conversation with Mark''s friend Henry, whom Mark has repeatedly
    confided in about the time loop. After helping Henry win his video game, Margaret
    has an epiphany. She creates a three-dimensional model of the times and places
    of the perfect moments using string. The shadow cast by the model creates an image
    of a , with a single vertex missing. She determines that the final event will
    occur at 7:00 PM at the pool.


    Margaret finds Mark sitting alone at the pool and explains that she is responsible
    for the time loop: this was the last day her mother is alive, and she was not
    willing to move past it. But she now believes that Mark was caught up in the loop
    too in order to allow her someone to move on with. The two of them kiss.


    Margaret goes to the hospital and says goodbye to her mother for a final time.
    She and Mark go outside. At midnight it begins to rain, signalling that the loop
    has been broken. The next morning they finally return the missing dog.'
  - 'Bobby has traveled via ferry to a small bed and breakfast for a romantic vacation
    with his girlfriend Jules. Expecting to reconnect with Jules, Bobby instead finds
    that he''s trapped in a loop where he and Jules repeat the same day. Each day
    ends with the pair getting murdered by a hooded figure. Attempts to leave the
    island or avoid death are unsuccessful, as he is unable to avoid death. He cannot
    leave the island due to the town shutting down the ferry in memorial of a couple
    who was mysteriously murdered. Assuming that the loop is related to the prior
    murders, Bobby digs for information from the bed and breakfast owner who cryptically
    tells him to do the right thing.


    Flashbacks show that the relationship between Bobby and Jules is strained, as
    he is suspected of being unfaithful. Their relationship is further strained by
    his growing agitation from the loops, which results in him picking fights with
    the townspeople. On one loop Bobby goes to drink at the local bar, where he confesses
    to the bartender that he cheated on Jules with one of her friends. He got the
    woman pregnant and pushed for her to get an abortion. The bartender tells Bobby
    that he must tell Jules the truth. When Jules arrives the two instead have a terrible
    fight and the night ends with the hooded figure murdering them.


    The following day Bobby decides to tell Jules the truth about the affair and abortion,
    also confessing to another affair prior to that. This results in another fight
    but successfully breaks the time loop, as Bobby wakes to find Jules gone. He returns
    home by himself, where he is arrested for murdering Jules. It is revealed that
    Bobby murdered Jules because she wanted to leave him and that this occurred prior
    to the trip. Bobby is imprisoned and given mental help, where he reads a letter
    Jules wrote about leaving him. He eventually confesses to killing her, but still
    insists that the events from the time loop occurred.'

  Context:
  - 'In 1985,  Andrew C. Thornton II drops a shipment of cocaine from his plane. He
    attempts to parachute out with a drug-filled duffel bag, but knocks himself unconscious
    on the doorframe, causing him to fall to his death. His body lands in Knoxville,
    Tennessee, where he is identified by Bob, a local detective. He concludes that
    the cocaine is likely from St. Louis  Syd White, and the remainder is missing.
    Meanwhile, in the Chattahoochee–Oconee National Forest, an American black bear
    eats some of the cocaine, becoming highly aggressive and attacking two hikers,
    Elsa and Olaf, killing the former.


    In northeast , middle schooler Dee Dee lives with her mother, nurse Sari. Dee
    Dee skips school with her best friend Henry in order to paint a picture of the
    falls in the forest. On the trail to the falls, the pair finds a lost brick of
    cocaine, and ingest some before they are attacked by the bear. Sari ventures into
    the forest to search for the children with park ranger Liz and Peter, a wildlife
    activist. The three find Henry clinging to a tree, hiding from the bear. The bear
    attacks, sending Peter stumbling through a pile of cocaine and slashing Liz in
    the process. The bear tries to climb a tree and attack Henry but gets attracted
    to a cocaine-coated Peter. Ignoring Henry, the bear kills Peter. Sari and Henry
    flee deeper into the forest, and Liz sends for help.


    In St. Louis, Syd sends his  Daveed to recover the remaining cocaine. Daveed travels
    to Georgia with Eddie, Syd''s son, who has grown depressed following the death
    of his wife and has abandoned his own son. They arrive in Georgia, as does Bob.
    At the forest station, Daveed gets into a fight with the Duchamps gang, three
    delinquents who cause trouble in the forest. After Daveed beats them, one of the
    members, Stache, agrees to take Daveed and Eddie to recover some of the cocaine
    he stashed in a gazebo. Liz arrives back at the station, pursued by the bear.
    Liz accidentally kills Ponytail, one of the Duchamps, before the bear slaughters
    Vest, the other one. Paramedics Beth and Tom arrive and collect Liz after a brief
    skirmish with the bear. They leave with Liz in an ambulance, but the bear pursues
    and jumps into the vehicle. In the ensuing chaos, Tom is killed by the bear, while
    Liz falls out of the ambulance and is dragged to death on the road. Beth loses
    control of the ambulance and crashes into a tree, causing her to fly through the
    windshield to her death.


    Sari and Henry discover that Dee Dee left them a trail of paint, which they use

    to cultivate the forest, but the unicorns opposed them. In reality due to the

    Gordi and Azulín. A priest instills a religious doctrine of hatred for unicorns
    in the troops. Azulín pretends to protect Gordi, and aspires to be the best recruit,
    hoping to become the Chosen One someday. But he grows resentful of the troop''s
    top recruit, Coco. He has also felt jealous of his brother since their birth when
    Gordi came out first, gaining the favor of their mother. When their mother left
    their father for another man, Azulín''s jealousy grew so vicious that he poured
    poison into his mother''s lemonade, killing her.

    as a hero to inspire the soldiers. He is also provided with a mask to cover the
    disfigured half of his face. Back at the forest, Gordi takes pity on María and
    nurses her back to health. Before the fight, María had stumbled upon the church
    and found the building now occupied by simians.

    María. Azulín and Gordi reunite. But when Azulín sees Gordi helping María, his
    rage boils over and he kills both Gordi and María. He drinks María''s blood to

  - 'After a traumatic experience, Edee Holzer is in the midst of therapy, revealing
    to her therapist that she doesn''t like to be around people. She leaves the city
    and moves to Wyoming where she purchases a small, remote cabin and resolves to
    live in solitude without any modern conveniences connecting her to the outside
    world, including telephones or cars.


    Initially, she struggles with basic provisions, including chopping firewood and
    fishing. When a black bear enters her cabin, eats her food, and destroys much
    of the rest of her supplies while she hides in her outhouse, she reaches her breaking
    point. Without a fire for heat or food to eat, she tries to hunt but cannot bring
    herself to shoot a deer she has in her sights. Overwhelmed, she attempts to take
    her life by shooting herself with the hunting rifle, stopping short when she remembers
    her sister Emma pleading not to hurt herself.


    During a violent snowstorm, the metal roof of her cabin becomes somewhat dislodged
    by the wind, making loud noises. She leaves the cabin to attempt repairs and is
    injured. A local hunter, Miguel and his nurse friend Alawa, rescue her and help
    her recover from her illness. Miguel remains to look after Edee by preparing her
    food, replenishing her supply of firewood, and restocking the rest of her cabin.


    Edee thanks Miguel for his kindness in helping her, but explains that she came
    to her cabin to be alone and wants to keep it that way. Miguel understands and
    offers to help equip her with better survival skills so that she can have the
    life of solitude that she wants. He shows her how to trap in the winter and hunt
    in the fall so she can provide herself with food. Over time they develop a friendship
    as Miguel continues to join her to hunt, harvest crops, and explore her land.
    Miguel shares that his wife and daughter died in a car accident eight years prior,
    while Edee simply reveals that she used to have a family. Miguel later remarks
    that if she doesn''t want to talk about her past she ought to consider what she
    wants her future to be like. She suspects that he searched her history on the
    internet, though he''s not even aware of her last name and explains that''s impossible.


    Miguel asks her to watch his dog while he goes away for a while, ostensibly for
    work. While he''s gone, Edee retrieves a collection of old photos revealing she
    was married with a son, and the father and son she saw fishing earlier on had
    been an apparition of her family. Months pass and Miguel hasn''t returned, so
    Edee packs her belongings and ventures off of her land for the first time since
    her arrival to find him. She makes her way into town on foot and eventually finds
    Alawa working at the local hospital. Alawa takes her to see Miguel, who is bedridden
    and dying from . On his deathbed, he confesses that he was driving the night his
    wife and daughter were killed and it was because he was  that the accident happened.
    Edee responds that her husband Adam and son Drew were killed in a random shooting
    in a concert hall. She thanks him for helping her heal and the life he gave back
    to her.


    Departing with his phone that he gifted to her, she calls her sister Emma for
    the first time since arriving in Wyoming.'
