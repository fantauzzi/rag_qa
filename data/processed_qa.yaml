  Context:
  - The story is set in a distant future world where humans have received longevity
    but lost their fertility, and are nearly extinct by population decline. The protagonist,
    a cyborg explorer, enters an underground world where artificially created species
    live. His mission is intended to research for their secrets of reproductivity.
    As the story goes on, it becomes gradually clear that the underground world is
    a kind of dystopia where dangerous monsters roam or ambush, and that the artificially
    created intelligent species developed a unique society. The story ends in an unexpected
    manner. Director Hori noted the film was the first part of a trilogy.
  - 'In 2063, astrophysicists on a climate-change-ravaged Earth find a habitable planet.
    A scouting mission is sent, although the roughly 86-year flight means that the
    grandchildren of the launch crew astronauts will be the ones who reach the planet.
    To help the launch crew cope with the knowledge that their remaining lives will
    likely be spent mostly in flight, the original 30 are bred through  and kept in
    isolation from the rest of the world. In order to extend their time in flight,
    they are launched on the  spaceship as young boys and girls, with senior program
    commander Richard (who fought to be included), to guide them through the early
    part of the journey. To  resources, the plan is for IVF to be performed when the
    crew turns 24, to be repeated on those offspring when they turn 24.


    During the tenth year of the flight, Christopher and Zac discover that the young
    folks are being given a blue chemical in their food to suppress sex drive and
    pleasure response, keeping them all docile and manageable. The pair stops taking
    the chemical, and their surging hormones drive them to become competitive, careless,
    and anxious to engage in sexual , specifically with their crew mate Sela, who
    has been trained to be the chief medical officer.


    During a repair effort outside the  to address a failed Earth communication system,
    Richard, who has been serving as chief officer, is killed, apparently by an unseen
    entity, and a fire damages more ship systems. Christopher is voted the new chief
    officer, which upsets Zac, who then tells the others to stop ingesting the chemical.
    The mission descends into madness, as many of the young men and women revert to
    their most primal state.


    Zac tells the others that an  killed Richard, and will protect them, letting them
    eat all the (closely conserved) food they want. He convinces all but five to follow
    him rather than Christopher. Christopher and Sela, who have become a couple, find
    and repair a video disk that reveals Zac killed Richard, precipitating the further
    systems damage by turning on the electricity to the communications array while
    Richard was working on it. They show the others, but Zac still convinces many
    that an alien is inhabiting one of them, leading many to follow Zac in vigilante
    murders of anyone he targets.


    Christopher inadvertently leads Zac to a hidden compartment on the ship, which
    proves to be weapons for their grandchildren to use on the planet. Christopher,
    Sela, and Phoebe are the only holdouts. Phoebe is killed, and the pack searches
    for Christopher and Sela. The pair tricks Zac into being ejected into space, and
    peace returns to . Sela is then voted chief officer. The crew decides to permanently
    forgo the blue chemical and learn to manage their natural emotions, as well as
    falling in love and having children naturally, instead of via IVF as had been
    originally planned.

    from orbit to be as earth-like as had been hoped.'
  - 'After a global catastrophe nearly wipes out humanity on Earth, Earth''s elites
    fled to a  space colony. A young astronaut named Blake from the Kepler colony
    returns to Earth with fellow astronauts Tucker and Holden. Their mission is to
    test whether Earth is suitable for human habitation and reproduction. Kepler-209
    residents have modern technology and space travel but they have become infertile
    from heavy radiation there. This is the second attempt to return to Earth.


    The space capsule lands roughly on a tidal flat near the Henderson Hub, a weather
    beacon that broadcasts telemetry data back to Kepler-209. Holden is killed, while
    Tucker commits suicide after a band of fertile humans, nicknamed "The Muds", wounds
    him and captures him and Blake, and removes technology from the shuttle. Blake
    is imprisoned by the Muds and nearly drowns, but she is saved by a girl named
    Maila.


    The Muds are invaded by a hostile group that kidnaps all of them. They are taken
    to a cargo ship that rises above the frequent floods and storms. The aggressors
    are led by a former Kepler-209 resident named Gibson, who was a survivor from
    a previous Earth mission led by Blake''s father, once thought to have no survivors
    as its capsule was destroyed along with its communication equipment.


    Blake realizes she is fertile, and she meets the children of the Muds, whom Gibson
    is educating. Gibson claims the Muds killed Blake''s father, but Blake learns
    that he has been locked away because he sided with the Muds, believing that Kepler
    residents should never return to Earth. Gibson introduces Blake to his adoptive
    son and his partner - she claims that he saved her and her son from certain death.
    After a brief reunion, Blake discovers the girls are being held captive for Gibson''s
    future breeding plans. She sides with the Muds, attacks the guards, and releases
    the girls and their families.


    After freeing the Muds, she goes to free her father. She notices Gibson moving
    toward the Henderson Hub. Blake comes to know that Gibson''s adoptive son Neil
    is actually her half-brother (after her father impregnated Neil’s mother). Blake’s
    fertility info is then attempted to be communicated by Gibson from the biometer
    which proves fertility of Keplers. She tries to stop news from Earth being broadcast
    back to Kepler-209, but Gibson sends the data. Blake strangles and drowns Gibson,
    almost drowning herself, but Maila''s mother rescues her and revives her. Blake
    and her father rejoin the Muds and Neil and they set out in a tugboat. A closing
    scene shows the Mud children hidden from the prior Kepler raiders fearfully watching
    an approach of figures through the fog, which turn out to be their kidnapped parents
    returning safely home.'
  - 'The short film opens up with an unnamed astronaut planting a garden in his spaceship
    but doesn''t realize that a meteor is on its way to crashing into the spaceship.
    As a result, his spaceship is destroyed, and he is left alone on a small deserted
    planet. He later removes plants from his garden and plants them on the planet,
    but in a matter of hours, the plants wither without air or water. He later witnesses  crash
    into the planet, which makes him believe there was someone on the ship. His plants
    suddenly regrow and create a tree, and notices a pinkish female alien with  hair
    making the tree grow. They later develop a relationship based on love at first
    sight, and the alien later removes plants from the spaceship to plant them into
    the planet, essentially making it a larger garden. The astronaut later decides
    to remove his helmet, but nearly dies from asphyxia. The alien decides to give
    him some of her air to make him breathe.


    Some months later, the astronaut spends his time with her, and taught her a few
    things like eating mangos. As the years go by, the couple develops their relationship
    and is seen having two daughters who have their own treats from their parents,
    an older girl with her mother''s hair but closely realistic to her father''s and
    a young girl with her father''s hair but closely to her mother''s ribbon hair.
    The alien later is seen as weak, to the point where she can no longer eat and/or
    walk. As a result, the planet withers and she dies into an aurora, which causes
    the astronaut to nearly die from asphyxia again til he nearly lives when he wakes
    up to his daughters, who are giving him air so that he can breathe again and make
    the planet regrows in an instant, revealing they have their mother''s powers in
    them.


    During the post-credits scenes, as he''s sleeping with his daughters and a pet
    alien dog, the astronaut witnesses another spaceship crash into the planet. Curious
    though, he and his daughters go to check out only to discover something that made
    him blush.'

  - 'In 1931, Jakob Fabian works as a copywriter for a cigarette company in Berlin.
    He aspires to become an author, while his hedonistic best friend, Stephan Labude,
    wishes to work in academia. The two often spend their evenings visiting brothels
    and clubs. Fabian holds a nihilistic view on love and life, having been traumatized
    by his experience as a soldier in World War I.


    During one of his outings at an underground club, Fabian meets Cornelia, an aspiring
    film actress. He falls in love with her and they begin a romantic relationship;
    although she cares for Fabian, Cornelia shows some ambivalence about whether the
    relationship will last. Fabian, Cornelia and Labude begin to spend time together.
    At one point, they swim in a lake despite Fabian''s weak swimming skills. They
    also stay at Labude''s father''s countryside home, where Cornelia makes Fabian
    sign a contract stating that he will not impede her career no matter what.


    In the midst of soaring unemployment and poverty in Germany, Fabian is laid off
    from his job. In contrast, Cornelia''s career begins to take off as she acquiesces
    to sexual advances from Makart, an older film producer. Fabian argues with Cornelia
    about her actions, though she promises that it will help “to make things work”
    for them. They express their love for one another, though she abruptly moves out
    of her lodging the next morning.


    While his relationship with his fiancée crumbles, Labude submits a thesis to Berlin
    University, hoping that it will be accepted. He has an antagonistic relationship
    with Weckherlin, the chancellor''s assistant. With the Nazi Party on the rise
    and beginning to impede on German life, Labude is arrested for his support of
    communism and holding rallies for dockworkers. He is soon bailed out by his father.


    Fabian visits a film studio where Cornelia is auditioning for a film role. She
    performs a heartfelt monologue, which impresses Makart and the other producers,
    and they give her the leading role. The monologue is in fact a letter to Fabian,
    imploring for them to meet again at a nearby café. When they meet, Fabian is cold
    towards her, arguing that the contract she had coerced him into signing was for
    her to commit infidelity without guilt. This upsets her, though Fabian soon apologizes
    and the two renew their continued support for one another.


    Labude is declared missing, with his father and Fabian searching for him in Berlin
    together. Some time later, Fabian finds Labude on a binge at a nude art studio.
    The latter has received a letter from his university, but has not yet opened it.


    Shortly after, Fabian is contacted by the police, who drive him to Labude''s fathers’
    residence. There, he is shocked to discover Labude dead from a self-inflicted
    gunshot wound. After confirming Labude''s identity, Fabian reads his suicide note;
    Labude laments his failed relationship and his rejection by the university, declaring
    that he is not good at anything else and implores Fabian to “live a better life”
    than his. An upset Fabian confronts the university chancellor about the rejection
    letter, who is confused as he had actually accepted the thesis. Realizing that
    Weckherlin had forged the letter as a prank, Fabian lunges at him and beats him
    almost to death before being restrained by witnesses.


    With no ties left to Berlin, Fabian returns to his hometown in Dresden. As he
    slowly recovers from his grief, he sees Cornelia in a magazine, having become
    a film star. He reaches out to her and she calls back, confiding in him that although
    she has become successful, she is not happy. The conversation becomes light-hearted
    and they make plans to meet at a café in Berlin.


    Excited to see Cornelia again, Fabian packs a suitcase and walks to the train
    station. On his way there, he sees three boys playing in a lake, reminding him
    of his time with Labude and Cornelia. He spots a boy standing on a bridge, appearing
    to attempt suicide. Fabian calls for the boy not to jump, but the boy does not
    hear him and falls into the water. Instinctively, Fabian jumps into the lake to
    save the boy. He is unable to pull himself out of a current and he drowns. The
    boy survives and emerges onto the shore, seeing Fabian''s belongings strewn everywhere
    but remaining unaware of what had just occurred. In Berlin, Cornelia waits for
    Fabian.'

    Dee skips school with her best friend Henry in order to paint a picture of the
    falls in the forest. On the trail to the falls, the pair finds a lost brick of
    cocaine, and ingest some before they are attacked by the bear. Sari ventures into
    the forest to search for the children with park ranger Liz and Peter, a wildlife
    activist. The three find Henry clinging to a tree, hiding from the bear. The bear
    attacks, sending Peter stumbling through a pile of cocaine and slashing Liz in
    the process. The bear tries to climb a tree and attack Henry but gets attracted
    to a cocaine-coated Peter. Ignoring Henry, the bear kills Peter. Sari and Henry
    flee deeper into the forest, and Liz sends for help.


    In St. Louis, Syd sends his  Daveed to recover the remaining cocaine. Daveed travels
    to Georgia with Eddie, Syd''s son, who has grown depressed following the death
    of his wife and has abandoned his own son. They arrive in Georgia, as does Bob.
    At the forest station, Daveed gets into a fight with the Duchamps gang, three
    delinquents who cause trouble in the forest. After Daveed beats them, one of the
    members, Stache, agrees to take Daveed and Eddie to recover some of the cocaine
    he stashed in a gazebo. Liz arrives back at the station, pursued by the bear.
    Liz accidentally kills Ponytail, one of the Duchamps, before the bear slaughters
    Vest, the other one. Paramedics Beth and Tom arrive and collect Liz after a brief
    skirmish with the bear. They leave with Liz in an ambulance, but the bear pursues
    and jumps into the vehicle. In the ensuing chaos, Tom is killed by the bear, while
    Liz falls out of the ambulance and is dragged to death on the road. Beth loses
    control of the ambulance and crashes into a tree, causing her to fly through the
    windshield to her death.


    Sari and Henry discover that Dee Dee left them a trail of paint, which they use
    to track her. Daveed and Eddie are taken to the gazebo but find Bob there with
    the stashed duffel of cocaine, who wounds Daveed. The bear appears, but Bob distracts
    it with the bag of coke. Bob is suddenly shot fatally by Syd, who reveals that
    he is under pressure from his superiors to retrieve the cocaine.


    Sari and Henry find a mourning Olaf, who leads them to Dee Dee''s hiding place:
    the bear''s cave containing its two cubs, revealing that the bear is a mother.
    Olaf leaves and is killed by the bear. Syd, Eddie, and Daveed find the cave, which
    leads out to a ledge behind the falls. The bear returns to the cave. Sari, Henry,

  - 'In a magical forest, unicorns lived alongside wild animals. But the bears found
    a  of knowledge in the ruins of a church. The book enabled the bears to gain sentience
    and form their own civilization. Over time, the bears physically evolved to a
    multi-colored "teddy bear" form. According to their beliefs, the bears wanted
    to cultivate the forest, but the unicorns opposed them. In reality due to the
    bears deforestation the unicorns decided to retaliate causing the bears to be  from

    will be over when their "" drinks the blood of the last unicorn, and a godlike
    being will return to the forest.


    Drill Sergeant Caricias trains a new troop of recruits that includes brothers
    Gordi and Azulín. A priest instills a religious doctrine of hatred for unicorns
    in the troops. Azulín pretends to protect Gordi, and aspires to be the best recruit,
    hoping to become the Chosen One someday. But he grows resentful of the troop''s
    top recruit, Coco. He has also felt jealous of his brother since their birth when
    Gordi came out first, gaining the favor of their mother. When their mother left
    their father for another man, Azulín''s jealousy grew so vicious that he poured
    poison into his mother''s lemonade, killing her.


    The camp''s leaders send the troops to the forest to find a missing squad, with
    Caricias and the Priest leading. In the forest, they find glowworms that they
    consider eating. The Priest warns that the scripture says not to eat them, but
    Caricias angrily defies the warning. The glowworms turn out to be , and the troops
    see frightening hallucinations that cost the lives of two recruits. Later on,
    they find the mutilated remains of the squad members. Sergeant Caricias goes insane
    as a result. Soon after, they stumble upon one lone unicorn and kill her. But
    other unicorns appear and fight the recruits, leaving only Azulín, Gordi and Coco
    alive. Azulín''s rage against Coco explodes, and he kills the wounded Coco and
    even  his corpse.


    The brothers find two other unicorns. Azulín badly wounds one of them, a filly
    named María. In trying to kill her, Azulín gets impaled by the other unicorn,
    sending him into a river, severely  the right side of his face in the fall. The
    river sweeps Azulín away, where another troop finds him. While Azulín recuperates
    in the hospital, the military leaders promote him to Lieutenant, and present him
    as a hero to inspire the soldiers. He is also provided with a mask to cover the
    disfigured half of his face. Back at the forest, Gordi takes pity on María and
    nurses her back to health. Before the fight, María had stumbled upon the church
    and found the building now occupied by simians.


    Azulín grows so popular among the soldiers that he leads a , killing the military
    leaders. He then organizes the bear army for one final massive assault to raze
    the forest. The unicorns then all unite to confront the bears. In the brutal final
    battle, all bears die except for the brothers, and all unicorns die except for
    María. Azulín and Gordi reunite. But when Azulín sees Gordi helping María, his
    rage boils over and he kills both Gordi and María. He drinks María''s blood to
    finally fulfill the prophecy. But María''s body morphs into a formless monster
