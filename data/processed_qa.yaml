    to the  for training as Widows. In the following decades, Shostakov is imprisoned
    in Russia while Romanoff and Belova become successful, dangerous assassins. Romanoff
    eventually defects to S.H.I.E.L.D. after helping  bomb Dreykov''s Budapest office,
    which apparently kills Dreykov and his young daughter Antonia.


    In 2016, Romanoff is a fugitive for violating the Sokovia Accords. She escapes
    from U.S. Secretary of State  and flees to a safehouse in Norway supplied by .
    Meanwhile, Belova kills a rogue former Widow but comes in contact with a synthetic
    gas that neutralizes the Red Room''s chemical mind-control agent. Belova sends
    antidote vials to Romanoff, hoping she and the  can free the other Widows, and
    goes into hiding. When Romanoff is unknowingly driving with the vials in her car,
    Red Room agent  attacks her. Romanoff escapes from Taskmaster and realizes that
    the vials came from Budapest. There she finds Belova, who reveals that Dreykov
    is alive and the Red Room is still active. Widows and Taskmaster attack them,
    but Romanoff and Belova evade them and meet with Mason, who supplies them with
    a helicopter.


    Romanoff and Belova break Shostakov out of prison to learn Dreykov''s location,
    and he directs them to Vostokoff, who lives on a farm outside Saint Petersburg.

    is Antonia, who suffered damage in the Budapest bombing that was so severe Dreykov
    had to put technology in her head to save her. This turned Antonia into the perfect
    soldier, capable of mimicking the actions of anyone she sees. Romanoff is unable
    to attack Dreykov due to a pheromone lock installed in every Widow, but negates
    that by breaking her own nose and severing her olfactory nerve. Shostakov battles
    Taskmaster while Vostokoff takes out one of the facility''s engines and then they
    lock Taskmaster in a cell.

    antidote. Romanoff copies the locations of other Widows worldwide from Dreykov''s
    computer as the facility begins to explode and fall. She retrieves two surviving
    antidote vials and frees Taskmaster from the locked cell. Vostokoff and Shostakov
    escape via a plane while Belova takes out Dreykov''s aircraft, killing him. In
    freefall, Romanoff gives Belova a parachute before battling Taskmaster. After
    landing, Romanoff uses one antidote vial on Taskmaster and gives the other to
    Belova along with the locations of the other mind-controlled Widows so she can
    find and free them. Belova, Vostokoff, and Shostakov say goodbye to Romanoff and
    leave with Antonia and the freed Widows. Two weeks later, Mason supplies Romanoff
    with a  to use in freeing the imprisoned Avengers.

    fled to a  space colony. A young astronaut named Blake from the Kepler colony
    returns to Earth with fellow astronauts Tucker and Holden. Their mission is to
    test whether Earth is suitable for human habitation and reproduction. Kepler-209
    residents have modern technology and space travel but they have become infertile
    from heavy radiation there. This is the second attempt to return to Earth.


    The space capsule lands roughly on a tidal flat near the Henderson Hub, a weather
    beacon that broadcasts telemetry data back to Kepler-209. Holden is killed, while
    Tucker commits suicide after a band of fertile humans, nicknamed "The Muds", wounds
    him and captures him and Blake, and removes technology from the shuttle. Blake
    is imprisoned by the Muds and nearly drowns, but she is saved by a girl named
    Maila.


    The Muds are invaded by a hostile group that kidnaps all of them. They are taken
    to a cargo ship that rises above the frequent floods and storms. The aggressors
    are led by a former Kepler-209 resident named Gibson, who was a survivor from
    a previous Earth mission led by Blake''s father, once thought to have no survivors
    as its capsule was destroyed along with its communication equipment.


    Blake realizes she is fertile, and she meets the children of the Muds, whom Gibson
    is educating. Gibson claims the Muds killed Blake''s father, but Blake learns
    that he has been locked away because he sided with the Muds, believing that Kepler
    residents should never return to Earth. Gibson introduces Blake to his adoptive
    son and his partner - she claims that he saved her and her son from certain death.
    After a brief reunion, Blake discovers the girls are being held captive for Gibson''s
    future breeding plans. She sides with the Muds, attacks the guards, and releases
    the girls and their families.


    After freeing the Muds, she goes to free her father. She notices Gibson moving
    toward the Henderson Hub. Blake comes to know that Gibson''s adoptive son Neil
    is actually her half-brother (after her father impregnated Neil’s mother). Blake’s
    fertility info is then attempted to be communicated by Gibson from the biometer
    which proves fertility of Keplers. She tries to stop news from Earth being broadcast
    back to Kepler-209, but Gibson sends the data. Blake strangles and drowns Gibson,
    almost drowning herself, but Maila''s mother rescues her and revives her. Blake
    and her father rejoin the Muds and Neil and they set out in a tugboat. A closing

    up to his daughters, who are giving him air so that he can breathe again and make
    the planet regrows in an instant, revealing they have their mother''s powers in

    the Ten Rings will go after her matching pendant. He reveals his past to Katy
    who insists on helping him. They find Xialing at a secret fight club, which she
    founded after escaping from Wenwu at 16. The Ten Rings attack the fight club and
    Wenwu arrives to capture Shang-Chi, Katy, Xialing, and her pendant.


    At the Ten Rings'' compound, Wenwu uses the pendants to reveal a mystical map
    leading to Ta Lo. Wenwu explains that he has heard Li calling and believes she
    has been held captive in Ta Lo behind a sealed gate. He plans to destroy the village
    unless they release her. When his children and Katy object, he imprisons them.
    They meet former actor Trevor Slattery, whom the Ten Rings imprisoned for impersonating
    Wenwu, and his hundun companion . They escape and Morris guides them to Ta Lo,
    which exists in a separate dimension with various Chinese mythological creatures.


    The group meet Li''s sister Ying Nan who explains the history of Ta Lo: thousands
    of years ago, the village''s universe was attacked by the soul-consuming  and
    its soul eaters, but was saved by a Chinese dragon called the Great Protector
    who helped seal the Dark Gate to the Dweller''s world. According to Nan, the Dweller-in-Darkness
    has been impersonating Li so Wenwu will use the ten rings to open the Gate. Shang-Chi,
    Xialing, Katy, Slattery, and Morris join the villagers in training and preparing
    for Wenwu''s arrival, using outfits and weapons crafted from dragon scales that
    are effective against the soul eaters.


    Wenwu and the Ten Rings arrive and attack. Wenwu overpowers Shang-Chi, pushes
    him into the nearby lake, and attacks the Gate with the rings. This allows some
    of the Dweller''s soul eaters to escape, and the Ten Rings join forces with the
    villagers to fight them. The Great Protector revives Shang-Chi and bears him from
    the lake to battle the soul eaters. Wenwu and Shang-Chi fight once more, and Shang-Chi
    gains the upper hand but chooses to spare Wenwu. The Dweller-in-Darkness escapes
    from the weakened Gate and attacks Shang-Chi. Wenwu saves Shang-Chi, bequeathing
    him the rings before the Dweller-in-Darkness kills him. Shang-Chi, the Great Protector,
    Xialing, and Katy slay the Dweller-in-Darkness. Afterward, Shang-Chi and Katy
    return to San Francisco, where the sorcerer  summons them to .


    In a mid-credits scene, Wong introduces Shang-Chi and Katy to  and  while researching

    off the coast of the  town of Portorosso. His parents forbid him from approaching
    the surface, fearing that he might be hunted by humans. One day, Luca meets Alberto
    Scorfano, a fellow sea monster child who lives alone in an abandoned tower on
    dry land. When Alberto encourages Luca to venture out of the ocean, he finds out
    that sea monsters turn into humans as long as they are dry. Luca begins sneaking
    out to meet Alberto and they become friends, wishing to own a Vespa and travel
    around the world.


    Upon discovering their son''s actions, Luca''s parents decide to send him to live
    in the  with his uncle Ugo. In retaliation, Luca runs away from home with Alberto
    to hide out in Portorosso. The boys run afoul of Ercole Visconti, the local bully
    and five-time champion of the Portorosso Cup, a triathlon of swimming, pasta-eating,
    and biking. When Ercole tries to soak Luca in a fountain, Giulia Marcovaldo, a
    young girl, stops him. In hopes of winning the money needed for a Vespa, the boys
    team up with Giulia for the triathlon.


    Giulia invites them to stay at her house and introduces her fisherman father,
    Massimo, who holds grudges towards sea monsters. Meanwhile, Luca''s parents infiltrate
    the town to find their son. Giulia and Luca bond over their love of learning,
    making Alberto jealous. When Luca shows interest in attending school, Alberto
    intentionally reveals his sea monster form to Giulia to prevent it. Unwilling
    to give himself up, Luca feigns surprise to be with Giulia, and a betrayed Alberto
    flees as Ercole''s gang show up and try to hunt him. Heartbroken, Alberto trashes
    everything in his hiding place. Shortly after, Giulia finds out that Luca is a
    sea monster as well, and sends him away for his safety.


    Luca heads to Alberto''s hiding place in an effort to reconcile with him and learns

    but Ercole knocks him to the wet ground, exposing his sea monster form, much to
    everyone''s horror. Luca this time helps him, albeit revealing himself as well.
    They resume biking, with Ercole now trying to harpoon them for money, which is
    stopped by Giulia smashing her bike against his.


    Luca and Alberto unintentionally cross the finish line, but turn back to help
    Giulia. When Ercole and other townsfolk confront them, Massimo stands up for them
    and insists that they have won. A few of the townsfolk are revealed to be sea
    monsters as well and Luca is finally reunited with his family. The humans welcome
    the sea monsters, with the exception of Ercole, whose prejudice turns him into
    an outcast. His henchmen, who were fed up with his abuse, throw him into the fountain
    and abandon him.


    Luca and Alberto buy a Vespa, but Alberto sells it to get a train ticket for Luca,
    allowing him to go to school in Genoa with Giulia. Luca''s family, Massimo, and
    Alberto see Luca and Giulia off at the train station, where they all promise to

  - 'In 1931, Jakob Fabian works as a copywriter for a cigarette company in Berlin.
    He aspires to become an author, while his hedonistic best friend, Stephan Labude,
    wishes to work in academia. The two often spend their evenings visiting brothels
    and clubs. Fabian holds a nihilistic view on love and life, having been traumatized
    by his experience as a soldier in World War I.


    During one of his outings at an underground club, Fabian meets Cornelia, an aspiring
    film actress. He falls in love with her and they begin a romantic relationship;
    although she cares for Fabian, Cornelia shows some ambivalence about whether the
    relationship will last. Fabian, Cornelia and Labude begin to spend time together.
    At one point, they swim in a lake despite Fabian''s weak swimming skills. They
    also stay at Labude''s father''s countryside home, where Cornelia makes Fabian
    sign a contract stating that he will not impede her career no matter what.


    In the midst of soaring unemployment and poverty in Germany, Fabian is laid off
    from his job. In contrast, Cornelia''s career begins to take off as she acquiesces
    to sexual advances from Makart, an older film producer. Fabian argues with Cornelia
    about her actions, though she promises that it will help “to make things work”
    for them. They express their love for one another, though she abruptly moves out
    of her lodging the next morning.


    While his relationship with his fiancée crumbles, Labude submits a thesis to Berlin
    University, hoping that it will be accepted. He has an antagonistic relationship
    with Weckherlin, the chancellor''s assistant. With the Nazi Party on the rise
    and beginning to impede on German life, Labude is arrested for his support of
    communism and holding rallies for dockworkers. He is soon bailed out by his father.


    Fabian visits a film studio where Cornelia is auditioning for a film role. She
    performs a heartfelt monologue, which impresses Makart and the other producers,
    and they give her the leading role. The monologue is in fact a letter to Fabian,
    imploring for them to meet again at a nearby café. When they meet, Fabian is cold
    towards her, arguing that the contract she had coerced him into signing was for
    her to commit infidelity without guilt. This upsets her, though Fabian soon apologizes
    and the two renew their continued support for one another.


    Labude is declared missing, with his father and Fabian searching for him in Berlin
    together. Some time later, Fabian finds Labude on a binge at a nude art studio.
    The latter has received a letter from his university, but has not yet opened it.


    Shortly after, Fabian is contacted by the police, who drive him to Labude''s fathers’
    residence. There, he is shocked to discover Labude dead from a self-inflicted
    gunshot wound. After confirming Labude''s identity, Fabian reads his suicide note;
    Labude laments his failed relationship and his rejection by the university, declaring
    that he is not good at anything else and implores Fabian to “live a better life”
    than his. An upset Fabian confronts the university chancellor about the rejection
    letter, who is confused as he had actually accepted the thesis. Realizing that
    Weckherlin had forged the letter as a prank, Fabian lunges at him and beats him
    almost to death before being restrained by witnesses.


    With no ties left to Berlin, Fabian returns to his hometown in Dresden. As he
    slowly recovers from his grief, he sees Cornelia in a magazine, having become
    a film star. He reaches out to her and she calls back, confiding in him that although
    she has become successful, she is not happy. The conversation becomes light-hearted

    to the girl, promising to save her. Unaware of her presence, Lars enters the van
    and reveals the girl''s name to be Jay. Inside, Ed grows suspicious of Lars''s
    strange behavior. As Lars exits the van to bring Jay some food, Darby goes back
    inside the cabin through the hole in the wall.


    Jay has Addison''s disease, which can cause an adrenaline overdose if she becomes
    too stressed. In the bathroom, Darby tells Ash about Jay. Ash agrees to help her.
    When Darby goes outside, however, Ash reveals that he is Lars''s brother and an
    accomplice in the kidnapping. Ash takes Darby back inside and threatens to kill
    her if she informs Ed and Sandi about Jay. Outside, Jay cuts herself free and
    runs into the woods. In the bathroom, Darby attacks Ash, but he gains the upper
    hand. Lars goes through the hole in the wall and stops his brother from strangling
    Darby. In the struggle, Darby takes Ash''s keys.


    Ash and Lars force Darby to help them look for Jay. Ash reveals that they are
    transporting her to their Uncle Kenny, who runs a human trafficking ring, while
    Lars ignorantly believes it to be "finding them better homes". Darby uses a flashlight
    to blind the kidnappers and runs away. Ash fires his firearm, alerting Ed and
    Sandi. Ed and Sandi find Jay unconscious in the snow. Darby goes inside the cabin
    and tells Ed and Sandi about the kidnappers. After locking the entrance, Ed negotiates
    with Ash and Lars. He promises to give them the car keys if they give Jay the
    medicine she needs to survive. As Darby hides the keys, Ash and Lars cover the
    cabin in gasoline. Jay wakes up and identifies Sandi as her maid. A flashback
    reveals that Sandi helped Ash and Lars take Jay from her home under the agreement
    she''d be ransomed, unaware of the truth. She agreed to meet with the kidnappers
    to give them Jay''s medicine. In the present, Sandi lets Ash and Lars inside.


    After learning that Darby is the only person who knows where the keys are, Ash
    kills Ed and Sandi and uses a nail gun to staple Darby to a wall. Her phone receives
    a text message; Ash reads it and informs her that her mother has died. Another
    text reveals that Corporal Ron is on his way to the cabin. When Ash threatens
    to hurt Jay, Darby reveals the key''s whereabouts. Ash gives his gun to Lars before
    leaving to search for the keys. Darby tells Jay to turn off the lights.


    Darby snorts heroin to numb the pain receptors to pull the nail out of her hand.
    With Lars distracted, she takes his gun as Ash returns. During a standoff with
    Darby holding Lars hostage, Jay hits Ash''s nailgun with a hammer, thus shooting
    a nail in Lars'' forehead. Darby and Jay run outside to make their escape. Ash
    punctures their vehicle and sets the cabin on fire. After Corporal Ron arrives,
    Darby shoots Ash while Ron shoots Darby. Ash takes her weapon and shoots Ron dead.
    As he prepares to kill Darby, she uses a screwdriver to puncture his neck, killing
    him. Darby uses Ron''s radio to call for help. In a flash-forward, Darby''s sister
    Devon visits her in rehab.'
