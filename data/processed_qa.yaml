  - 'In the distant future, Duke , ruler of the planet Caladan, is assigned by the
    Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV to replace Baron Vladimir Harkonnen as the fiefholder
    of Arrakis, a harsh desert planet and sole source of "", a valuable psychotropic
    substance that imparts heightened vitality and awareness. Spice is key to interstellar
    travel, giving Spacing Guild Navigators the ability to guide starships to traverse
    space instantaneously and safely. Shaddam plots for House Harkonnen to retake
    Arrakis, secretly aided by his Sardaukar troops, to destroy House Atreides. Leto
    is suspicious of the Emperor but weighs the risks against the power of controlling
    Arrakis and making an alliance with its mysterious natives, the Fremen.


    Leto''s concubine, Lady Jessica, is an acolyte of the Bene Gesserit, an exclusive
    sisterhood whose members possess advanced physical and mental abilities. As part
    of their centuries-long , they instructed her to bear a daughter whose son would
    become the Kwisatz Haderach, a Bene Gesserit and  superbeing with the clairvoyance
    necessary to guide humanity to a better future. However, she disobeyed and bore
    a son, . Throughout his life, he is trained by Leto''s aides, Duncan Idaho, Gurney
    Halleck, Suk doctor Wellington Yueh, and the Mentat Thufir Hawat, while Jessica
    teaches him Bene Gesserit disciplines. Paul confides in Jessica and Duncan that
    he is troubled by visions of the future. In response to Paul''s increasing prescience,
    the Reverend Mother and Imperial Truthsayer Gaius Helen Mohiam visits Caladan
    and subjects him to a death-alternative  to assess his humanity and impulse control,
    which he passes. Mohiam insists that Baron Harkonnen spare Paul and Jessica during
    his coup, to which he duplicitously agrees.


    House Atreides arrives at Arrakeen, the fortress stronghold on Arrakis. Duncan''s
    advance party has made contact with the Fremen. The natives revere Paul and Jessica,
    which Jessica explains is due to the Bene Gesserit  on Arrakis centuries earlier.
    Leto negotiates with Fremen chieftain, Stilgar, and meets the Imperial Judge of
    the Change, Dr. , a  who lives among the Fremen. Kynes briefs them on the dangers
    of spice harvesting, and the giant s which travel under the desert and make the
    use of protective Holtzman shields unwise. During a flight, they dramatically
    rescue a stranded spice-harvesting crew from a sandworm; Paul''s exposure to the
    spice triggers intense premonitions.


    An attempt to assassinate Paul with a hunter-seeker fails. Yueh betrays the Atreides
    and disables Arrakeen''s shields, allowing the Harkonnens and Sardaukar to invade.
    He incapacitates Leto, planning to exchange him for his wife, who is the Baron''s
    prisoner. Yueh replaces one of Leto''s teeth with a poison gas capsule with which
    the Duke can assassinate the Baron. Leto releases the gas, killing himself and
    the Baron''s Mentat, Piter De Vries, but the Baron survives. Though the Baron
    has arranged to have Paul and Jessica dropped deep in the desert to die, a compassionate
    Yueh has left them with stillsuits and other survival supplies. Jessica uses a
    Bene Gesserit technique called "" to overpower and kill their captors. Paul and
    Jessica journey overnight in the desert where Paul, surrounded by spice, has visions
    of a bloody "holy war" fought across the universe in his name.


    Baron Harkonnen gives command of Arrakis to his nephew, , and orders him to restart
    spice production to recover his costs. Paul and Jessica are found by Duncan and
    Kynes, and Paul discloses his plan to marry one of Shaddam''s daughters to avert
    the civil war that would ensue from news of the Emperor''s treachery. They are
    found by the Sardaukar, and Duncan sacrifices himself to allow Paul and Jessica
    to escape. Kynes is mortally wounded by Sardaukar but summons a sandworm that
    devours them. In the deep desert, Paul and Jessica encounter Stilgar''s tribe,
    including , the girl in Paul''s visions. Fremen warrior Jamis opposes Stilgar''s
    lenience to them and challenges Paul to a ritual duel to the death, which Paul
    wins. Against Jessica''s wishes, Paul joins the Fremen to fulfill his father''s
    goal of bringing peace to Arrakis.'
