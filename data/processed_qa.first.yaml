  Context:
  - 'In a mystical land filled with enchanting forests and breathtaking castles, there
    resides a legendary giant gorilla named Donkey Wong, who has lived peacefully
    for centuries. But everything changes when a powerful and malevolent sorcerer
    named Malvador casts a wicked spell on him, transforming him into a fearsome and
    dangerous creature. Malvador, fueled by jealousy and darkness, imprisons the beautiful
    and strong-willed Princess Diana of Astoria in a hidden cave, guarded by Donkey
    Wong. The princess, known for her intelligence, courage, and compassion, refuses
    to be cowed by her captivity and never loses hope.

    Meanwhile, in the village of Fableton, lives a humble plumber named Guido. He''s
    an ordinary guy with extraordinary dreams of being a hero. When the news of Princess
    Diana''s plight spreads throughout the kingdom, Guido decides to embark on a perilous
    journey to rescue her. Armed with his wits, determination, and a set of plumbing
    tools, Guido sets off on his adventure.

    Guido faces numerous challenges and dangers along the way. He encounters mystical
    creatures, battles malevolent sorcerers'' minions, and navigates treacherous terrains,
    all in pursuit of freeing Princess Diana from her captivity. Through each challenge,
    Guido grows as a person, realizing that true heroism lies not only in physical
    strength but also in compassion, empathy, and humility.

    As Guido ventures deeper into the heart of the enchanted forest, he finally confronts
    the mighty Donkey Wong. A fierce battle ensues between the two, and despite Donkey
    Wong''s immense power, Guido manages to appeal to the humanity buried within the
    giant gorilla. Slowly, Guido discovers that Donkey Wong was once a guardian of
    the forest, and the wicked sorcerer''s spell had corrupted him. With kindness
    and understanding, Guido manages to break the curse, restoring Donkey Wong to
    his true self.

    Princess Diana, impressed by Guido''s bravery and his compassionate approach to
    Donkey Wong, is liberated from her captivity. As they journey back to the kingdom
    together, Princess Diana forms a deep bond with both Guido and Donkey Wong. She
    admires Guido''s resilience and good heart, and while she values their friendship,
    she believes that her heart belongs to the kingdom and its people.

    Upon returning to her castle, Princess Diana decides to adopt Donkey Wong as a
    loyal companion. She realizes the importance of respecting and protecting all
    creatures, no matter how different they may seem. Guido understands Princess Diana''s
    decision and accepts it gracefully, proving his genuine affection for her. Instead
    of feeling defeated, Guido finds purpose in being a hero for the people of Fableton,
    embracing his role as a plumber who can fix not just broken pipes, but also mend
    broken spirits.

    In the end, Guido remains friends with Princess Diana, and she becomes a respected
    ruler known for her wisdom and compassion. Donkey Wong, now redeemed and living
    in the castle''s vast gardens, symbolizes the unbreakable bond between humans
    and nature, serving as a constant reminder of the adventure that brought them
    all together'
